# This code calculates the volume of polyhedron with triangular facets. 

# User should input the numpy array of triangular mesh

polyhedron_mesh_volume.py is the file which implements the function. When the code is executed, it will ask for the numpy array file
including its path.  After the file name is entered, code will execute and will output the volume on the screen. 

unit_test.py  is the test case file.  It checks if the calculate_triangular_mesh_volume function is calculating the volume
correctly by comparing the function output with the volumes known apriori.
